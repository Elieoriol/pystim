Psychopy Changes
================

The following changes to the psychopy source code are necessary to run the
application. Psychopy source can be found in the python site-packages folder.

1. In order to allow simultaneous offsetting and scaling of the pyglet
   window, lines 621-625 in::

    /psychopy/visual/window.py

   need to be changed to the following:

   .. code-block:: python
      :lineno-start: 621

      #GL.glMatrixMode(GL.GL_MODELVIEW)
      if self.viewScale is not None:
          scale = self.viewScale
      else:
          scale = [1, 1]

2. In order to allow capturing of window frames to generate screen captures,
   line 950 needs to be updated to be compatible with the latest release of
   PIL. In the same file, ``fromstring()`` needs to be changed to ``frombytes
   ()``.

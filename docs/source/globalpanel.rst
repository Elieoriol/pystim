Global defaults panel
=====================

The rightmost panel contains global defaults for the program. These are
window properties along with parameters that apply to all stims. The
selections made in the global panel can be saved.

For the parameters to be applied, the window instance must be regenerated by
recreating the window. The exceptions to this are:

* log
* start trigger wait
* protocol reps
* preferred dir
* capture
* background

These parameters can be changed without having to regenerate the window. Most
parameters are self explanatory. The rest are described below:

* **center offset** (pix)
        Number of pixels in x and y directions to move the center of the window.
        This is useful in case the window size is larger than the monitor size,
        but the center of the screen should correspond to the center of the
        window.
* **scale** (xy)
        A scale factor applied to all sizes in each direction. A scale of -1
        can be used mirror the window along an axis.
* **pix per micron**
        Conversion ratio to go between pixels and microns. Used to convert
        distances to pixels behind the scenes.
* **frame rate** (fps)
        This is the actual frame rate of the monitor, not the desired frame
        rate. This value is used to determine how many frames stims should
        last for.
* **protocol reps**
        Number of repetitions the stim(s) will run through. This is
        equivalent to pressing the ``Run`` button several times.
* **start trigger wait** (s)
        If triggering is desired, this is the delay between a first trigger
        being sent and the onset of the stims. If set to 0, stims will start
        immediately, and only trigger if set to do so.
* **gamma monitor**
        The gamma correction applied to all colors in the window. If set to
        default, no gamma correction will be applied. See
        :doc:`GammaCorrection` for documentation.
* **capture**
        If set to True, will generate a movie on each run. This movie is
        generated from screenshots of the window at each frame, so is a
        direct copy.
